<p> Some of my talents is that I am very good at apex legends. I am top 70 in the state in tennis and i almost built a computer.
</p>
<p> I also like reading some of the things i like to read are the Eragon triliogy. Which is about a boy that finds a dragon egg in a forest that everybody thinks is cursed because the evil tyrant Galbatorix once lost half of his men in that forest. When the boy finds the egg he is gifted magical powers and becomes a dragon rider. I also like comic books like Nova, SpiderMan, and the Winter Soldier.
